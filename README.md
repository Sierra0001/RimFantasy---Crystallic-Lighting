# RimFantasy - Crystallic Lighting

This mod adds a number of new magical gemstone furniture that radiates light into their surroundings.

These furniture are safe to place under the rain and are quite beautiful to look at. Be careful though, the energies within the crystals are barely contained and excessive damage will produce a small explosion.

### Features

- 2 Lamps (General lighting)
- 3 Wall Lamps (Plant growing/General lighting)
- 3 Pedestals (Plant growing/General lighting)
- 1 Research

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.

### Compatibility

- Save Game Compatible
- Will not play nice with other gemstone mods without a patch.
