# RimFantasy - Crystallic Lighting

This mod adds 2 new magical gemstone pedestals that radiates light into their surroundings.

These pedestals are safe to place under the rain and are quite beautiful to look at. Be careful though, the energies within the crystals are barely contained and excessive damage will produce a small explosion.

### Features

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but can be obtained through trades and from salvaging certain objects.
